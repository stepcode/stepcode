**** Introduction

Delta assists you in minimizing "interesting" files subject to a test
of their interestingness.  A common such situation is when attempting
to isolate a small failure-inducing substring of a large input that
causes your program to exhibit a bug.  Our implementation is based on
the algorithm found here: http://www.st.cs.uni-sb.de/dd/ .  Please see
doc/using_delta.txt for documentation.

**** Installation

% tar xvzf delta.tar.gz
% cd delta
% make
% make check #optional

The resulting executables end up in delta/bin.  Thus, put delta/bin on
your path, copy them to a directory on your path, or simply use them
in place.

**** Requirements

  Perl5
  GNU make
  gcc (including cpp)

To rebuild the distribution from scratch you also need flex.

We have not set up configuration to look for other C compilers yet.
You can get much of the functionality even if you only have Perl5.
Other make-s may work.  Please see the documentation.

**** Acknowledgments

The program delta was written by Daniel S. Wilkerson with suggestions
