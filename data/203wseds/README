The EXPRESS schema in this directory is based on ISO 10303-203, an
international standard which is copyrighted by ISO. ISO has granted
NIST permission to publicly distribute the EXPRESS source from ISO
standards. The EXPRESS schema provided in this software release has
been modified to facilitate its use with this software and is provided
as an example schema only. This disclaimer must be included in any
redistribution of the EXPRESS schema. This disclaimer must also be
included in the file containing the EXPRESS schema.

The EXPRESS source for the modified AP 203 schema contained in the
file 203wseds.exp has modifications to it from the standard based on
Standard Enhancement and Discrepancy System (SEDS) reports.  SEDS
reports are an informal way for ISO TC 184/SC4 to document errors,
ambiguities, and enhancements to the standard; and to recommend
corrections for formal adoption via a technical corrigendum,
amendment, or revision.

The data files in this directory were developed by ITI as part of the
STEP conformance testing project.  The files contain data that conform
to the modified AP203 schema.
